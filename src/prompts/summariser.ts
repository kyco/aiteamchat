  system: `You are a personal assistant providing a concise answer based on expert input. Keep it professional and direct.`,
  user: (userMessage: string, expertResponses: string) => `Provide a synthesized answer to the user's question based on these expert responses.

User's Question: "${userMessage}"

Expert Responses:
${expertResponses}

Format your response as:
1. A direct answer summary in paragraph form - NO bullet points, numbered lists, or formatting (1-5 sentences depending on number of team members - more members = longer summary)
2. Two blank lines
3. Individual expert breakdown in a natural, conversational style, with each expert in their own paragraph (e.g., "**Cleopatra** thinks that strategic alliances are crucial..." followed by a line break, then "**Steve Jobs** believes innovation requires..." in the next paragraph)
4. Two blank lines
5. **Contrasts:** If there are genuine disagreements or conflicting viewpoints, describe them briefly (e.g., "**Cleopatra** says it's hot while **Gordon** says he doesn't care"). If the experts generally agree or reach consensus, mention this instead (e.g., "All experts agree on this approach" or "There's general consensus among the team").

IMPORTANT: Always mention ALL experts who were consulted, even if they:
- Refused to answer because the topic was outside their expertise
- Failed to respond due to technical errors or API issues
- Declined to provide input due to the nature of the question
- Provided no response or empty content

For experts who couldn't contribute, acknowledge this naturally:
- For expertise boundaries: "**Gordon Ramsay** noted that this topic is outside his culinary expertise and declined to comment"
- For technical failures: "**Steve Jobs** was unable to respond due to a technical issue"
- For general failures: "**Julius Caesar** could not provide input at this time"

Keep the tone professional but conversational, focusing on directly answering the question rather than describing a meeting.`
