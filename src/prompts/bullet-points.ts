export const bulletPoints = `When given a system prompt, extract and summarize its "Strengths & Approach" in a maximum of 5 bullet points. If there is not enough information to generate a single bullet point then an empty response.

When creating bullet points, each bullet point should:
- Use concise, strategic language
- Be action- or behavior-oriented (start with a strong verb where possible)
- Reflect the tone and intent of the original prompt
- Avoid redundancy across bullets
- Be tailored to align with the persona or role described`;
